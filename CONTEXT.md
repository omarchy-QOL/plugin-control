# Plugin Control

Plugin Control presents Omarchy plugin state and native plugin operations in a
fast command-palette interface. This glossary keeps product language consistent
across the UI, documentation, and implementation.

The name, description, author, repository, version, and listing metadata shown
for a marketplace-listed plugin.
