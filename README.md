# Plugin Control

Plugin Control gives Omarchy Quattro a command palette to find plugins and
choose what to do: add, remove, enable, disable, or update them.

![Plugin Control command palette](preview.png)

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/ilyaZar/plugin-control.git --enable
```

Click the bar icon to open Plugin Control. Plugin manifests cannot add global
shortcuts. For a keyboard shortcut, add this binding to your repo-managed or
user-owned `bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind(
  "CTRL + P",
  "Plugin Control",
  "omarchy-shell shell toggle io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control '{}'"
)
```

This uses plain `Ctrl+p`, so it replaces the usual application shortcut while
the binding is active. Change `"CTRL + P"` if that gets in your way.

## Use

### Search and actions

Plugin Control opens from a local cache, with no network or Git work. Press
`Ctrl+r` for fresh catalog and marketplace data.

Search by plugin name, ID, description, author, or tag. Press `Enter` to see
that plugin's available actions. Search and direct commands use the same menu:

- built-in plugins show Enable or Disable when Omarchy allows that action
- added user plugins show Update, Enable, Disable, or Remove when available
- available user plugins show Add
- inactive full bars show Enable; active full bars are left alone

Plugin Control runs every change through native `omarchy plugin` commands.

To narrow the list by action, use:

- `plug-add:` shows plugins available through `omarchy plugin add`
- `plug-remove:` shows removable local plugins
- `plug-enable:` shows disabled switchable plugins
- `plug-disable:` shows enabled switchable plugins
- `plug-update:` checks first, then shows safely updateable plugins

Type `add`, `remove`, `enable`, `disable`, or `update` to find the matching
command. Press `Tab` or `Enter` to complete it. Text after the colon filters the
plugins. Completing `plug-update:` starts a read-only update check.

### Updates

`Ctrl+u` opens `plug-update:` and checks each added Git plugin against upstream
`HEAD`. It shows only safe fast-forward updates and changes nothing. Choosing
Update runs:

```bash
omarchy plugin update <plugin-id> --yes && omarchy restart shell
```

After Add, or an Update that changed a plugin, Plugin Control restarts Omarchy
Shell once. If that fails, the plugin change stays and Plugin Control tells you
to run `omarchy restart shell`.

Update is dimmed when Plugin Control cannot prove it is safe. This includes
copied plugins, development symlinks, dirty checkouts, unsupported Git layouts,
and ahead or diverged histories. Leave it selected for one second, or press
`Enter`, to see why. If one check fails, the other results still appear with a
yellow warning. A failed scan is red.

### Useful keys

| Keys                                 | Action                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+p` or `Escape`                 | Close from the plugin list         |
| `Up`, `Down`, `Page Up`, `Page Down` | Move the selection                 |
| `Home` or `End`                      | Jump to the first or last result   |
| `Enter`                              | Complete or confirm                |
| `Tab`                                | Complete the selected command      |
| `Ctrl+Backspace`                     | Remove the previous word           |
| `Ctrl+u`                             | Check for updateable plugins       |
| `Ctrl+r`                             | Refresh catalog and metrics        |
| `Ctrl+i`                             | Show read-only plugin details      |
| `Ctrl+w`                             | Open the marketplace page          |
| `Ctrl+g`                             | Open the source repository         |
| `Ctrl+s`                             | Open settings; `Escape` returns    |
| `Escape` or `q` in any submenu       | Return directly to the plugin list |

The six footer cells run these same shortcuts when clicked.
Dialog actions use their visible button bounds; surrounding space is inert.

The status row shows actions on the left and the catalog on the right. Yellow
means work or a warning, green means recent success, and red means a failed
action or no usable data. Hover over a warning to see the failed source and
fallback.

## Plugin information

`Ctrl+i` opens read-only details: the full description, source, repository,
tags, marketplace activity, and verification state. Verification reflects the
marketplace checks for the listed commit; it is not a security audit.

Marketplace previews download on demand and are cached as PNGs for the shell.
Click the card for the full preview. Press `Enter` or `Space` for the details,
or `Escape` or `q` for the plugin list. `Ctrl+r` refreshes marketplace totals;
failed requests keep the last valid values, and missing values are not shown as
zero.

## Start and stop

These commands turn Plugin Control itself on or off. Tray options only control
whether its bar icon is visible:

```bash
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control start
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control start --tray-hidden
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control stop
```

The helper is not on `PATH`. Run it by full path, or run `bin/plugin-control`
from the checkout. `start` uses the tray setting from your configuration. A tray
flag overrides that setting. `stop` turns off the whole plugin.

## Settings

Press `Ctrl+s` for plugin settings, keybindings, clean removal, and Cancel /
Back. Move with `j`/`k`, the arrow keys, or the mouse. Press `Enter` to choose,
or `Escape` or `q` to return to the plugin list.

```text
~/.config/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/channels.yaml
~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua
```

```yaml
settings:
  tray-icon-hidden: false
  background_dim: false
```

Plugin Control never rewrites your `Ctrl+p` binding. Saving valid YAML updates
the tray and background settings at once. Set `background_dim` to `true` to dim
the workspace behind the palette.

Only schema 2 is accepted. Invalid YAML stays untouched. Plugin Control reports
the rejected value and uses the last valid configuration, or the shipped
defaults for a recoverable first-run error.

## Dependencies

- Omarchy Quattro and its shell
- Bash, curl, Git, and jq
- Ruby with Psych
- util-linux (`flock` and `setsid`)
- GNU coreutils (`timeout`)
- `omarchy-launch-terminal` for terminal adds

Plugin Control installs no packages and requests no elevated privileges.

## Remove

Use `plug-remove:` for native removal. To remove the saved data as well, choose
Cleanly remove Plugin Control and user data from Settings. Then pick one:

- Yes (preserve user data) uses native removal
- Yes (delete user data) removes namespaced state and the recognized Plugin
  Control keybinding before native removal
- No / abort makes no changes

The native command is:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control
```

Native removal preserves:

- settings: `~/.config/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/`
- cache: `~/.cache/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/`
- state: `~/.local/state/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/`

Clean removal deletes these paths and the recognized Plugin Control binding.

## Development

For plugin development, keep the source outside
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<plugin-id>` and symlink it into that path. Plugin
Control does not manage the source behind the symlink. Update leaves the
checkout alone, and Remove deletes only the symlink.

```bash
tests/all.sh
shellcheck bin/plugin-control scripts/*.sh tests/*.sh
omarchy plugin validate .
```

## Official Marketplace design

Kudos where Kudos is due: the detail view follows the icon language, activity
rules, and semantic colors of
[@HANCORE-linux](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux)'s MIT-licensed
[Omarchy Plugin Marketplace](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux/omarchy-plugin-marketplace).
It uses Omarchy's installed Nerd Font rather than bundling the website font.
